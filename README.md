# Wizard Chess
Search-based low-intelligence international chess AI with visible UI.

This project was originally finished in 2016 (when AlphaGo won against Lee Sedol), and then I revamped it in 2023 with some UI and performance improvements. But overall, it's just a side project of mine to practice TypeScript (this is my first TypeScript project), Web Worker, and the aplpha/beta pruning algorithm.
